        /// The order has been received by Alpaca, but hasnâ€™t yet been routed to the execution venue. This could be seen often out side of trading session hours.
        case accepted
        
        /// The order has been received by Alpaca, and routed to the exchanges, but has not yet been accepted for execution. This state only occurs on rare occasions.
        case pending_new
        
        /// The order has been received by exchanges, and is evaluated for pricing. This state only occurs on rare occasions.
        case accepted_for_bidding
        
        /// The order has been stopped, and a trade is guaranteed for the order, usually at a stated price or better, but has not yet occurred. This state only occurs on rare occasions.
        case stopped
        
        /// The order has been rejected, and no further updates will occur for the order. This state occurs on rare occasions and may occur based on various conditions decided by the exchanges.
        case rejected
        
        /// The order has been suspended, and is not eligible for trading. This state only occurs on rare occasions.
        case suspended
        
        /// The order has been completed for the day (either filled or done for day), but remaining settlement calculations are still pending. This state only occurs on rare occasions.
        case calculated
